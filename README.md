This notebook focuses on data preprocessing and cleaning. The dataset was first loaded and explored to understand its structure, data types, and missing values. Appropriate cleaning techniques were applied by filling missing numerical values with the median and categorical values with the mode. Duplicate records were checked and removed to ensure data quality. Necessary data type corrections were performed to support accurate computations. Feature engineering was carried out by creating new variables such as HouseAge and TotalSF to enhance the dataset for analysis and modeling. The final cleaned and transformed dataset was then exported as a CSV file for further analytical and machine learning tasks.
